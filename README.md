**Dice Rolling Game for Multiple Players**  

This Python script implements a simple multiplayer dice rolling game for 2 to 4 players. The objective is to reach a maximum score of 69. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points until they decide to hold or roll a 1.

- **Player Input**: The script allows the user to enter the number of players (between 2 and 4).
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Each player takes turns to roll the die and accumulate points during their turn.
- **Roll Mechanism**:
  - Players can choose to roll the die or hold their current score.
  - If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose the points accumulated during that turn.
  - Players keep rolling until they either roll a 1 or choose to hold.
- **Game End**: The first player to reach or exceed a score of 69 wins the game.

This script provides a simple way to simulate a dice game and demonstrate core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions in Python.
